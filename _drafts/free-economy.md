A bit counter-intuitive and can be controversial: Is there a flip side of wide-spread “free” stuff in information technology? Why big companies give away some version of their software products for free? And who are the ultimate beneficiaries of crowd-sourced, free online labor market (i.e. online forums)?

When the market price is set to zero, all sellers are forced to give away their services for free. If you write a small piece of useful software, a library, you kind of have to upload it in online repos, so people can use it for free, even if making that product meant your blood, sweat, tears and time, making it your afterwork weekdend side project. It's a forced charity.

Free doesn't last long. Most big-name newspapers are now behind paywalls; Medium have made their content subscription based too, Guardian is begging for money to their readers "Since you are here .......", so is wikipedia "it is awkward but we need money.

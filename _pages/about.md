I am Mahbubul Alam, a PhD economist based out of Washington DC and interested in the application of data, data science and predictive analytics in decision making and solutions to complex problems we face every day. I am passionate about developing new methods, improve upon existing ones or blend different approaches (e.g. ARIMA with System Dynamics for predictive modeling) to get new insights. Time series and spatial data analytics (GIS) is my current areas of interest. My technical writings have been published 20+ international journals.

I can be reached via: mab.datasc[at]gmail.com or Twitter.

Thanks!!

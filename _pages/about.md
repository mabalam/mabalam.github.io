I am an interdisciplinary quantitative scientist based in Washington DC. I find interest in all things data, in all fields of application and decision-making. A model agnostic, I tend to use whatever tool I have, to solve a problem or answer a question. In my work I have borrowed tools/methods/techniques from traditional statistical and machine learning fields, to social science, to Goegraphical Information Systems (GIS). I have worked in 4 different continents and my 20+ technical writings have appeared in international journals.

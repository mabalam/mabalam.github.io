I am an interdisciplinary quantitative scientist based in Washington DC. I find interest in all things data, in all fields of application and decision-making. A model agnostic, I tend to use whatever tool I have, to solve a problem or answer a question. In my work I have borrowed tools/methods/techniques from traditional statistical and machine learning fields, to social science, to Goegraphical Information Systems (GIS). I have worked in 4 different continents and my 20+ technical writings have appeared in international journals.

> Currently thinking about:  
A bit counter-intuitive and can be controversial: Is there a flip side of wide-spread giving away "free" stuff in information technology? Why big companies give away some version of their software products for free? Who are the *ultimate* beneficiaries (not an easy guess) of open source products and free online labor markets (i.e. online help forums)? Can you continue to get quality online content for free, unlimited, indefinitely? If so why Wikipedia is begging for donations?  
There is a cost (time, labor) for producing contents, who bears the cost?

I am an interdisciplinary quantitative scientist based in Washington DC. I find interest in all things data, in all fields of application and decision-making. A model agnostic, I tend to use whatever tool I have, to solve a problem or answer a question. In my work I have borrowed tools/methods/techniques from traditional statistical and machine learning fields, to social science, to Goegraphical Information Systems (GIS). I have worked in 4 different continents and my 20+ technical writings have appeared in international journals.

Thinking about: 
> A bit counter-intuitive and can be controversial: Is there a flip side of wide-spread "free" stuff in information technology? Why big companies give away some version of their software products for free? And who are the *ultimate* beneficiaries of crowd-sourced, free online labor market (i.e. online forums)?
